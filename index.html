      <h3>What my students say about me</h3>

      <div class="quote">
        <blockquote>
          My understanding and mastery of the course material for COMP 202 (McGill's introductory programming class) dramatically improved once Horatiu began tutoring me one-on-one in personalized sessions that were customized for my particular needs and gaps in knowledge.
          As someone who possessed little to no prior coding experience, I definitely struggled to adjust to computational thinking.
          In addition, I was overwhelmed by the fast pace of a large and impersonal class, where it can be embarrassing to admit in front of hundreds of other students that I needed the concept of loops to be re-explained, yet again.

        Horatiu's one-on-one tutoring sessions far surpassed the quality of instruction I received when I consulted TAs (who generally are undergrad CS students lacking formal pedagogical training) during their tutorials/office hours.
        Many TAs I consulted were stumped by questions that Horatiu could quickly help me understand because of his invaluable professional experience as an instructor, mentor, and curriculum developer at a well-known coding bootcamp for over 5 years.
        I could tell throughout our sessions that his bachelor's in CS and master's in CS Education uniquely positioned him to be an excellent tutor whom the average CS TA could not possibly compete with.
        Our sessions were significantly more productive and informative because Horatiu was adept at deconstructing intimidating problems and concepts by persistently using various approaches until one explanation would finally click.

        On top of Horatiu's deep knowledge of programming and pedagogical techniques, his tutoring sessions provided me with personalized attention that was logistically impossible for TAs and professors to match.
        Debugging code takes time, and office hours are spread very thinly among hundreds of students who all have the same deadlines to meet for the class.
        The individual attention Horatiu provided as a tutor was absolutely priceless to me as a beginner CS student because I knew it was paramount at this stage to obtain a solid grasp of programming fundamentals.

        However, it was actually Horatiu's incredible patience and understanding, and his genuine desire for my success, that made him a standout tutor for me.
        Learning to code can be an arduous process that triggers personal insecurities, but Horatiu was empathetic and compassionate toward beginner coder struggles.
        His ability to sincerely empathize with the confusion of new coders created an exceptionally safe environment for me to repeatedly ask very basic questions and write shitty code with zero hints of judgment, frustration, or impatience exhibited by him.
        Furthermore, as a tutor, Horatiu never made me feel dumb or self-conscious about the steep learning curve I was experiencing at the time.
        In fact, he often reassured me that my issues and hang-ups were extremely common for CS beginners, which crucially helped build up my eventual confidence as a new coder.

        During the first two months of the semester, I majorly regretted taking COMP 202 because I was positive it would destroy my GPA.
        But I ultimately ended up with an A in the class, which frankly would have been impossible without Horatiu's expert tutoring.

          Hora is a great teacher and mentor.
          His mentorship really gave me the confidence to believe I could become a software developer.

          From explaining concepts clearly to challenging your knowledge/assumptions, I felt his training prepared me to think like a developer!
